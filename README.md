## Introduction

This repository is forked from [testla-screenplay-playwright-js](https://github.com/testla-project/testla-screenplay-playwright-js) to extend it.
This package uses the [Testla screenplay core package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testla/screenplay) to implement the screenplay pattern for Playwright.
By the way, gikyoku means "screenplay" in Japanese.
